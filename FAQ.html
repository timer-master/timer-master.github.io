         Timer Master’s Screen Time tool can assist you! With this feature, you can set a time for screen time and a time for breaks. With this, you won’t forget to stop playing your video game. This feature also limits your screen time to a max of 60 minutes and a minimum screen time and break time difference of 40 minutes.
