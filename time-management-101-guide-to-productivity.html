  <h1 class="title">Time Management 101: Your Guide to Productivity</h1>
  <p class="blog">Time management is an important skill to posses as it assists with many
    activities required for your academic career and adulthood. With these
    simple tricks, you’ll be working as efficiently as a robot in no time!

  <h1 class="heading">Prioritize Your Tasks</h1>
  <p class="blog">If you have a piece of homework due tomorrow, and a piece of homework due next week, what do you do first? While it may seem like its such an obvious question; you would definitely start with the homework due tomorrow. However, many people don’t prioritize their tasks and only do what they want to do. By doing this, you can end up being late for many homework assignments.<br><br>Many people don’t bother with prioritizing their tasks. They think that they’ll end up being able to finish all the tasks that they allot in a day, but what if they can’t? If you suddenly have an emergency, your computer crashes, or the power goes out, you won’t be able to finish everything! That is why it is so important to start off with the most important and urgent task when you start to work.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Limit Your Screen Time</h1>
  <p class="blog">Limiting screen time is tough for many students, especially because they haven’t matured, and don’t understand the importance of resisting the temptation of screen time. A feature that we’ve created in Timer Master to combat this problem is the Screen Time feature. It allows a maximum amount of 60 minutes in a screen time slot, then you have to take a minimum amount of 20 minutes in a break.<br><br>However, our feature isn’t perfect. When the timer for screen time goes off, nothing can really stop you from playing video games. The only person who can control that is you. You have to restrain yourself and use your willpower. While features like this will help you in your battle, the one who will have to do most of the work is you.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Allot a Fair Amount of Tasks Per Day</h1>
  <p class="blog">Finishing up work does not mean filling your day to the brim with tasks. If you do, it is impossible for you to finish, because no one can work for an entire day; you will also feel the stress. You didn’t finish everything you allotted today, and you’ll have to make it up tomorrow. If you also allot too much work tomorrow, then this will just become a snowball effect and you’ll spend many sleepless nights catching up on late assignments.
<br><br>
    Another reason to not allot too many tasks in one day is that you won’t work with consistent quality. It’s hard for people to work on tasks for a whole day and maintain quality. You might manage to finish your tasks, but it won’t matter, because your assignments will be poorly graded due to lack of effort.
    
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Avoid Multitasking</h1>
  <p class="blog">Multitasking might seem like a way to finish all your tasks in one day, but it will end up lowering the quality of your work! Just like the red flag we mentioned earlier, with more work, you are unable to maintain a good quality. By doing twice the work in a certain amount of time, you can allot half the brain power, leading to typos, mistakes, and poor-quality work. It is a lot more worth it to just work on your tasks separately.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Remove Distractions</h1>
  <p class="blog">When working, put your devices away so that the notifications, buzzes, phone calls, etc. won’t disturb you. Many times, you lose half the time you are “working” from checking your phone or playing video games. It is unwise to leave your phone nearby when trying to work on a formal project; it can disturb your train of thought and distract you from working, leading for you to even get rejected from a job because of it!
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Conclusion:</h1>
  <p class="blog">Time management isn’t easy, but by following these quick and easy five
    steps, you are sure to be able to work hard. Remember now, prioritize your
    tasks, limit your screen time, allot a fair amount of tasks per day, avoid
    multitasking, and avoid distractions. These tips will make you a Time
    Management champion! You can also always rely on Timer Master to help with
    organizing your day or setting timers to limit your screen time.
