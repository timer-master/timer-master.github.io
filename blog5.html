    <h1 class="title">Timeboxing: How to Allocate Your Day for Maximum Efficiency</h1>
    Managing time - the enemy of students everywhere. Students will sink under
    the stress of homework and extracurriculars building up if they can manage
    their time. With more and more competitive college admissions, being able to
    do more work in less time is a skill that every good student has mastered.
    By doing more work in less time, students will clear up their schedules,
    relieve stress, and be more productive. <br><br>Time management isn’t just a problem
    for students, but also adults. Completing your work, projects, and
    presentations, whether with a group or individually, while all at the same
    time squeezing in time for family and friends is going to be a part of most
    people’s lives, so managing time is a necessary skill to succeed in life.
    <br><br>One mistake most people commonly make when trying to plan their day is to
    just shove as many things as they can fit in a day. However, very few people
    can work for hours at a time, without any break, and result in good quality
    work. By inserting breaks between work, at an advised amount of 1 break/40
    minutes, one can work efficiently while keeping up good quality work. This
    is where timeboxing comes in.

    <h1 class="heading">The Method</h1>
    Timeboxing is a simple time management technique first introduced by James
    Martin as a part of agile software development. When timeboxing you allocate
    a fixed time period to complete a planned activity. During that period, you
    work on the task until the time is up, when you take a break. During that
    time, you assess whether you've reached your planned goals. This approach is
    very helpful when handling project management tasks, personal errands, or
    other projects. It is important to note its difference with time blocking,
    where you allocate time periods in order to find time for everything on your
    agenda.

    <h1 class="heading">How to do it</h1>
    When timeboxing, start by finding a suitable task, like something you don’t
    want to do or don’t want to spend too much time on. Next, set a goal. For
    example, when writing a 25-page research paper in a month, your goal could
    be to write one page per day. You would finish in 25 days, with five extra
    days to edit and revise. Now that you have a goal, figure out how much time
    you want to work for each day. For example, you could timebox so that you
    complete one page in three hours. This would mean working for an hour and
    then taking a break for twenty minutes after, repeating this three times.
    When your time is up, stop working immediately and reflect on your
    efficiency. In the end, when your entire task is completed, you can reward
    yourself. This will help to motivate you, therefore improving your
    efficiency.

    <h1 class="heading">Important Reminders:</h1>
    One crucial thing to remember in this method is to not overextend your
    break. While breaks are necessary to help you work more effectively, by
    overextending your break, you will deprive this method of all efficiency.
    While you might not want to, as work is not very pleasing, by knowing when
    to stop your break, you will save a lot of time for yourself.

    <h1 class="heading">Conclusion:</h1>
    When trying to complete tasks, using timeboxing is a very effective
    strategy, and you will soon find your work efficiency improve.
