  <h1 class="title">Prevent Addiction: Screen Time Management</h1>
  <p class="blog">Screen addictions are a major problem with not only children but also with
    adults. At times, it can be hard to work when video games sound so much more
    fun. Today, we’ll explore three great methods to explore your screen
    addiction: a work/reward system, alternate hobbies, and device isolation.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">1. Work/Reward System</h1>
  <p class="blog">A great method to end your screen time addiction is to start a work/reward
    system. While this method may seem questionable, you will find that this
    method is highly effective if done right. This method is similar to having
    breaks between work periods, but instead of doing work or chores, you reward
    yourself with screen time. <br><br>Instead of screen time being a lure for working
    less effectively, it can end up turning into an incentive. For example, if I
    walk the dog, finish my homework, and wash the dishes, I will reward myself
    with a 45-minute screen time slot. Now, not only will you complete tasks
    quickly, but also decrease your screen time. This leads to a more effective
    day, and you’ll quickly realize how much extra time you have! <br><br>However, when
    using this method, there are two traps to be aware of. Firstly, you might
    have an unbalanced work/reward ratio: if I complete a math question, I will
    have screen time for an hour. Obviously, rather than breaking your
    addiction, this will make it worse. So, consider having someone else to help
    you check your work/reward system to make sure it is balanced. Another trap
    that you might fall into is rushing through your tasks to get screen time.
    While screen time is a powerful incentive, it is vital for you to not rush
    through your work and keep up the quality, all while working efficiently for
    your screen time.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">2. Find a New Hobby</h1>
  <p class="blog">Another proven way to help cut one’s screen time addiction is to find a new
    hobby. Whether it be something complex or simple, having a new hobby and
    something to do when bored can easily help slow one’s screen time addiction.
    Some hobbies you could start include knitting, reading, painting, gardening,
    and so much more! Or, pick up a new sport. Playing sports greatly benefits
    your overall health. Not only does it provide much-needed exercise, but
    studies also show that spending time outdoors helps your eyes. <br><br>However, all
    methods have flaws. While a new hobby could cull screen time, it won’t bring
    it all the way. Many times, screen time will be more compelling than another
    “boring” old hobby. This makes it important to exercise strong willpower to
    resist the temptation. However, once you really get into your new hobby, you
    might find yourself starting to favor that hobby over screen time.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">3. Isolate Your Devices</h1>
  <p class="blog">Finally, you can also put your devices somewhere you won’t see them. For
    example, you might want to put your Nintendo Switch in the basement. Or, you
    can store your phone in a box that you keep far away from you, so you won’t
    check it every time you hear a notification. Like they say, out of mind, out
    of sight. This method doesn’t have to be that extreme, but if you can
    properly stow your devices away in a safe place, it can go a long way for
    your screen time addiction. <br><br>However, the most effective time to use this
    method is at bedtime. Many people, especially teens, plan on going to bed at
    a sufficient time, but after their phone pings, they go check their phone.
    This then turns into catching up on all the TikTok you’ve been missing out
    on, and this “quick checking” will turn into hours. Fortunately, if you use
    this solution and put your phone outside your bedroom, this will help you
    overcome addiction.
  </p>

  <h1 class="heading">Conclusion</h1>
  <p class="blog">If you need to cull your screen time addiction or if you want to help a
    friend or family member with theirs, then you can use the three methods
    mentioned in this article: a work/reward system, a new hobby, or isolating
    your gaming devices. However, one thing to keep in mind is that no method is
    perfect, and these methods only help stop an addiction: the main work is up
    to you and your willpower. Or, you can combine methods and use them
    together. <br><br>Hopefully, this article has helped you in your battle against
    screen time! In no time, the new and improved you will be thanking us!
