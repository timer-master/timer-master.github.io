    <h1 class="title">Breaking Procrastination: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
    In the boring life of a student, school-age students have found many ways to
    entertain themselves. Whether that be playing video games, watching
    television, or scrolling on their phones, everyone has something they do in
    their leisure time. However, these sources of entertainment might tempt
    someone into playing their video game too much, watching an unhealthy amount
    of television, or just spending the entire day sitting in a chair scrolling
    through TikTok. With more entertainment and free time, you’ll end up having
    less time to do your work. This is called procrastination: leaving work
    later because it isn’t due immediately, and instead, having free time now.
    Many students fall under the trap of procrastination: “Why should I finish
    the assignment now? It’s due in 5 days, I’ll have plenty of time,” many
    students think. This is the mindset that leads to procrastination. Students
    will leave it from one day to the next, and then to the next, and end up
    barely finishing right before the deadline, or sometimes, not at all! To
    break this unhealthy mindset, we offer you some helpful strategies.

    <h1 class="heading">Stay Organized</h1>
    Breaking procrastination is not just doing all your work the day it is
    assigned; instead, it is doing a balanced amount of work each day of the
    week. Once you receive an assignment, whether it be homework or a big
    project, think about it right away. Thinking long-term is a vital tactic. In
    a busy schedule filled with extracurriculars and other activities, using
    tools like your student planner, or Timer Master’s Time Planner and To Do
    can help you schedule your time. For example, you can enter your tasks
    long-term tasks into To Do, recording when a piece of homework is due and
    your goals for your long-term projects and their deadlines. Then, use To
    Do’s alarm feature to help you remember the deadlines. <br><br>However, it is also
    important to schedule your day. After school hours, students are faced with
    a packed schedule. They not only need to allocate free time but also juggle
    various homework and extracurricular activities. This is where Time Planner
    comes in. Simply enter your task, set a start and end time, and click on the
    timer icon. A timer pops out, and use that timer to make sure you stay on
    track. Using Time Planner greatly helps you to visualize your day and stay
    on schedule, completing everything you need to do while also having free
    time. <br><br>By planning out your week and your day, you can gauge how much work
    you have to do each day and allocate free time when you’re done with your
    work.

    <h1 class="heading">Starting Working Right Away</h1>
    The largest red flag you can encounter when starting to work on homework is
    feeling like you don’t want to work on it now; “I’ll work on it later,” you
    think. However, this mindset will end up pulling you behind. What if your
    assignment is due on Monday, and you plan to work on it on Sunday, but your
    family decides to go camping that day? Then, you’ll fall behind on work, and
    you won’t manage to finish in time because you procrastinate. It’s important
    to know that what you might not always end up working, as you might
    encounter challenges along the way. What if your homework turns out to be
    harder than expected? However, if you start working right away, you can
    finish your assignment on time, all at the same time accounting for
    unexpected events. This will help you finish your assignments quicker, and
    you’ll find your life to be less stressful.

    <h1 class="heading">Chunk Your Work</h1>
    If you are handed a huge writing assignment, this task might look daunting,
    and you might not even want to start working on it. But if you break your
    assignment into multiple parts, like outlining, drafting, writing, and
    editing, this will greatly relieve the pressure that is on you. By focusing
    on one task at a time, this increases your work quality and efficiency,
    rather than worrying about other things. Procrastination is often a product
    of stress. By breaking down your assignments into smaller tasks, this helps
    to decrease stress, therefore preventing procrastination.

    <h1 class="heading">Change Your Mindset</h1>
    One of the biggest reasons people tend to procrastinate is catastrophizing.
    This happens when people make a big deal out of something. For example, they
    might think an assignment is tough, boring, painful, or hard, so they won’t
    start on it until they absolutely have to - right before the deadline. In
    reality, a simple piece of homework won’t kill you. Many students also tend
    to make excuses, like “There’s plenty of time left,” “I’m not feeling it
    right now,” “I still have two more days,” “I work better under pressure,”
    etc. Be honest with yourself. These are all excuses you try to make, leading
    you to keep procrastinating just to the point of the deadline, when you
    realize you have to do it. <br><br>Believe in yourself, and your academic abilities
    as a student, and you’ll overcome this mindset. Think about all the
    positives of completing this assignment - no more stress, more relaxing free
    time, and more time to hang out with your friends.

    <h1 class="heading">Find a Partner</h1>
    Lastly, another useful thing to do is to find an accountability partner.
    This might not necessarily be your best friends, as they might distract you
    from finishing your work. Find someone responsible, or another peer that
    struggles with procrastination, and help each other out. In this
    relationship, you connect with someone (call, text, etc) at certain time
    intervals (such as once per week or every two days). Share your deadlines,
    and help each other stay on track, and committing to what you will do before
    your next meeting. Not wanting to go back on your word, this can be a great
    way to squash procrastination. Remind each other to complete their work
    right away and not procrastinate, and soon you’ll find your days to be much
    easier.

    <h1 class="heading">Conclusion:</h1>
    Procrastination is a problem with not only students around the world, but
    also adults. Implementing useful and effective methods, like staying
    organized and mapping out your schedule, start working right away, breaking
    down big tasks, changing your mindset, and finding an accountability partner
    will help you break procrastination and decrease your stress.
