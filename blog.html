        In the boring life of a student, school-age students have found many
        ways to entertain themselves. Whether that be playing video games,
        watching television, or scrolling on their phones, everyone has
        something they do in their leisure time. However, these sources of
        entertainment might tempt someone into playing their video game too
        much, watching an unhealthy amount of television, or just spending the
        entire day sitting in a chair scrolling through TikTok. With more
        entertainment and free time, you’ll end up having less time to do your
        work.

        much more fun. Today, we’ll explore three great methods to explore your
        screen addiction: a work/reward system, alternate hobbies, and device
        isolation.

        Let’s say you have to create a 20-slide presentation and practice
        presenting within a month. Your plan? Work 20 minutes a day. While this
        may seem like a valid goal and plan, this is actually an unpredictable
        plan that could very well end in failure. For example, what if you’re
        caught up in other projects and events, and can’t create room in your
        schedule? An important part that this plan is missing is a progress
        tracker. In a long-term plan with many unpredictable variables, like the
        ones given in our example, one needs to implement time management tools.

        Managing time - the enemy of students everywhere. Students will sink
        under the stress of homework and extracurriculars building up if they
        can manage their time. With more and more competitive college
        admissions, being able to do more work in less time is a skill that
        every good student has mastered. By doing more work in less time,
        students will clear up their schedules, relieve stress, and be more
        productive.

        Timers are the most underused tool that people ignore, but it actually
        is very helpful. Why? Timers help people plan their day and remind them

        allot time for different activities, and reduce the stress on your daily
        life. Here are some other ways to use your timer effectively:
